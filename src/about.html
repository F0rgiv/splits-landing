        <about class="about dark-font-child">
            <p>After spending many an hour working on custom excel files to help manage and track the ownership of songs
                and albums. Not to mention the payouts of any sales, streams etc. to the artists, producers and labels.
                We started to ask ourselves. Is there was a better way? Turns out that unless you were willing to fork
                out some serous coin there wasn’t. Thus beginning our journey and Splits.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Together we are working to create a SAS application that can function efficiently and cheaply to not only
                resolve these issues for larger labels but the small indie artist as well. All without the headaches of
                a custom solution or that end up being more than your payouts.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As artists and managers ourselves we know firsthand the pains and challenges of growing sales in the
                industry and are working to resolve them for ourselves and you!</p>
